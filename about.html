                    Life is an ordeal for many. Obstacles to the full blooming of human potential are numerous.  Many things need to change.  Maladies afflicting our politics, justice system, policing, education, healthcare, and other such vital issues need urgent scrutiny. They need to be studied, debated, criticised and eventually recast to ensure a life of peace and dignity for all. But public discourse today is focussed on trivial issues diverting attention from important problems.</br> </br>
                    At the same time, efforts are on at various fronts and on various levels towards creating a better society where men and women can lead a tolerably good life and achieve their full potential. </br></br>
                    I believe the layman also has a role to play in this regard. He can also add his mite to the ongoing efforts towards achieving this onerous but achievable task.  </br></br>
                    The website consists of my published articles, occasional ruminations on the happenings around us and a few photos taken by me. </br></br>
                    CRITIQUE OF THE PRESENT IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS A BETTER FUTURE. </br></br>
